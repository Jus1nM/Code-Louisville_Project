#Code Louisville Data Analytics project 1
The idea behind this project was inspired by the documentary, "Persona:  The Dark Truth Behind Personality Tests."
This documentary explores the origins of the popular personality test, Myers-Briggs, developed by a mother and daughter who were inspired by Carl Jung's book, "Psychological Types."
I won't go into detail about the documentary here - you'll need to watch it for yourself.  However, the documentary made me wonder, "which personalities, if any, are more often successful in business?  Do certain personalities gravitate toward a particular field or industry?  Do some personalities make more money than others?
For this project, I decided to use a sample size of 50 people, and what better sample to use than Fortune 50 CEOs, from the top 50 companies within the United States?
Unfortunately, finding people's Myers-Briggs' test results proved to be quite difficult.  So, for the sake of this project, I decided to substitute the Myers-Briggs test results with Zodiac signs instead, as these are much more accessible.
