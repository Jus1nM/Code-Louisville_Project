# Personality types in business

The idea behind this project was inspired by the documentary, "Persona:  The Dark Truth Behind Personality Tests."
This documentary explores the origins of the popular personality test, Myers-Briggs, developed by a mother and daughter who were inspired by Carl Jung's book, "Psychological Types."
I won't go into detail about the documentary here - you'll need to watch it for yourself.  However, the documentary made me wonder, "which personalities, if any, are more often successful in business?  Do certain personalities gravitate toward a particular field or industry?  Do some personalities make more money than others?
For this project, I decided to use a sample size of 50 people, and what better sample to use other than CEOs from the Fortune 50, the top 50 companies within the United States?
Unfortunately, finding people's Myers-Briggs' test results proved to be quite difficult.  So, for the sake of this project, I decided to substitute the Myers-Briggs test results with Zodiac signs instead, as these are much more accessible.
If you are unfamiliar with the Myers-Briggs personality types, you can read about them here:  https://www.myersbriggs.org/
Likewise, if you want to read up on the different Zodiac signs and their respective elements, go here:  https://www.zodiacsign.com/

This project was made using the following:
  -  Python 3.10.6
  -  Visual Studio Code
    - I used a Jupyter notebook within VScode
  -  You will need the following modules:
      -  Pandas; Matplotlib; Seaborn
        - In your terminal:
          - pip install pandas
          - pip install matplotlib
          - pip install seaborn
        
  *To make it easier to read the CSV file to run the code, I recommend having the CSV file in the same directory as the .ipynb file.  Otherwise, you'll need to specify the path to the .csv for the Pandas csv_reader.*

About the data used in this project:  
The Forbes Fortune 50 list can be found here:  https://fortune.com/fortune500/2022/search/  
As for the CEO's zodiac signs, I had to look each one using Google.  The more well-known CEOs were easy to find but for the others, I had to look up their birthdays to determine their zodiac sign.  I also used Google to find their networth.  Then I compiled all the data into a CSV file.
